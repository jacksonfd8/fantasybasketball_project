# Discovering winning fantasy basketball strategies with data

This is a self-motivated project to discover successful tactics in fantasy basketball. I love competing against my friends in fantasy basketball, but I never really utilized historic data to formulate strategies for the future. I hope to demonstrate my data science skillset throughout this project.


**For data, I clean and combine multiple data sources before comprehensive analysis:**
- Historical draft results (2015-2018) from Yahoo
- Historical final rosters (2015-2018) from Yahoo
- Basketball Monster Player Rankings from Basketball Monster


### The first phase: Exploratory Data Analysis

**Description of skills exercised:**
- Exploratory data analysis is performed with the use of Python libraries: Pandas and Matplotlib
- Creating a dataset through the use of multiple data sources
- Python skillset is displayed through the use of: written functions, iterations, multiple 'for' loops
